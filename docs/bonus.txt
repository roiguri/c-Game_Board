Visualization System

- HTML-based game visualization with interactive playback
- Step-by-step replay of the entire game with animation controls
- Displays a description of chosen actions and their outcome.
- Displays tank positions, directions, shells, mines, walls, and wall health
- Shows player stats (shells remaining, active/destroyed status)
- Supports countdown timer display
- A visualiztion manager enables using multiple visuzlizers - provides an API
  for easier integration with different visualizers.
* Mostly done with AI

Google Test Framework Integration

Tests for all components: GameBoard, Tank, Shell, Algorithms, Collision, Etc
Edge case testing for board wrapping, collisions, and game rules
Mock objects for testing algorithmic behavior in isolation
Test fixtures for complex test scenarios
* Configuration of gtest enviroment was done with AI

*Instructions to run:*

Visualization:

  Build the project with:
    mkdir build && cd build
    cmake -DENABLE_VISUALIZATION=ON ..
    make

  Then Run:
    ./tanks_game <input_file>
  
  # Visualization HTML generated as output_<input_file>_visualization.html
  # Open in any browser to view the interactive game replay

Tests:

  Build the project with:
    mkdir build && cd build
    cmake -DENABLE_TESTING=ON -DENABLE_VISUALIZATION=ON ..
    make

  Run tests with:
    ./bin/tests/tanks_game_tests
