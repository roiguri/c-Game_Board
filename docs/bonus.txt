# Bonus for exercise 3:

## Web-Based UI Server

A self-contained web interface for the Tank Simulator providing browser-based configuration and real-time simulation execution.

### Functionality
- **Mode Support**: Basic, Comparative, and Competition simulation modes with custom result displays
- **Real-Time Execution**: Live console output streaming
- **Interactive Configuration**: Dynamic form controls with file path validation and configuration summary
- **Professional Results Display**: Parsed results with leaderboards, and board visualization

### Architecture
- **Backend**: C++ HTTP server using cpp-httplib for REST API endpoints
- **Process Management**: Simple popen()-based execution with output capture and error handling
- **Frontend**: Vanilla HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript with modern design and responsive layout
- **API Design**: RESTful endpoints for simulation control, output polling, and result retrieval
- **Build Integration**: CMake-managed dependencies with optional UI compilation flag

### Usage

Build with UI enabled:
```bash
cd build
cmake -DENABLE_UI=ON ..
make tank_simulator_ui
```

Run the server:
```bash
./tank_simulator_ui
```

Access via browser: http://localhost:8080
