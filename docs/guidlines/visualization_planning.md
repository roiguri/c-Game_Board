# Tank Battle Visualization Implementation Plan

## Phase 1: Basic Landing Page with Configuration

**Goal:** Create a simple landing page that allows basic game configuration before launching.

1. **Create HTML Landing Page Structure**
   - Simple form layout with game configuration options
   - Start Game button that transitions from setup to visualization view

2. **Implement Core Configuration Options**
   - Text area for board input (manual entry for now)
   - Algorithm selection dropdowns for Player 1 and Player 2
   - Basic visual settings (color scheme selection)

3. **Integrate with Existing Visualization**
   - Create a system where configuration leads to visualization
   - Pass configuration parameters to the game engine
   - Add option to return to configuration from visualization

## Phase 2: Basic Configuration Processing

**Goal:** Add validation to ensure game boards are valid.

1. **Board Validation**
   - Syntax checking for board input
   - Verification of required elements (tanks, dimensions)
   - Visual feedback for validation errors

## Phase 3: Auto Board Generator

**Goal:** Add capability to automatically generate valid game boards.

1. **Basic Generator Implementation**
   - Random board generation algorithm
   - Controls for board size and wall density
   - Preview of generated board
   - Apply/Regenerate options

## Phase 4: Custom Rules Configuration

**Goal:** Allow customization of core game rules.

1. **Core Rules Settings**
   - Number of shells configuration
   - Cooldown period adjustments
   - Movement speed settings
   - Game timer options

## Phase 5: Visual Board Editor

**Goal:** Provide an intuitive interface for creating and editing boards.

1. **Basic Editor Implementation**
   - Interactive grid for placing elements
   - Element palette (walls, tanks)
   - Simple click-to-place interaction
   - Edit/Save/Load functionality

## Phase 6: Visual Enhancements

**Goal:** Improve the visual experience of the game.

1. **Enhanced Visualization**
   - Transition animations between states
   - Visual effects for actions (shooting, explosions)
   - Improved tank and board representation
   - Additional information overlays

## Possible Next Steps

**Future enhancements that could be implemented as needed:**

1. **Advanced Board Generation**
   - Board templates (open arena, maze, etc.)
   - Symmetry options (horizontal, vertical, rotational)
   - Mine density controls

2. **Advanced Rules Settings**
   - Victory condition customization
   - Special gameplay modes
   - Power-up/special ability configuration
   - Environmental effects

3. **Advanced Editor Features**
   - Copy/paste regions
   - Symmetry tools
   - Undo/redo functionality
   - Template libraries

4. **UI Refinements**
   - Mobile responsiveness
   - Polished design elements
   - Consistent theme across all components
   - Accessibility improvements
   - Performance optimizations

5. **Extended Game Settings**
   - Tournament mode
   - Leaderboard and statistics
   - Algorithm performance analysis
   - Custom algorithm parameters
   - Board scenario challenges
   - Integration with external tools

```

### Integration Approach

1. Design with modularity in mind so features can be added incrementally
2. Create clear interfaces between components to allow independent development
3. Prioritize core functionality before cosmetic enhancements

### Development Timeline Estimation

| Phase | Estimated Duration | Priority |
|-------|-------------------|----------|
| 1     | 1-2 weeks         | High     |
| 2     | 1 week            | High     |
| 3     | 1-2 weeks         | Medium   |
| 4     | 1 week            | Medium   |
| 5     | 2-3 weeks         | Medium   |
| 6     | 2 weeks           | Low      |

Note: These estimates assume 1 developer working part-time on the visualization system.
