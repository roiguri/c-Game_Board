# Tank Battle Assignment 3 - Implementation Status Summary

## Project Overview
**Assignment:** Advanced Programming Semester B 2025 - Assignment 3  
**Deadline:** August 24th, 2025, 23:30  
**Goal:** Multi-threaded Tank Game Simulator with dynamic library loading

---

## ðŸš§ REMAINING IMPLEMENTATION TASKS

### 1. **Simulator Executable Naming** ðŸ”´ CRITICAL
**Issue:** âœ… RESOLVED - Executable renamed to `simulator_318835816_211314471`  
**Location:** `/Simulator/simulator_318835816_211314471` - correct location and name  
**Status:** âœ… COMPLETED - CMakeLists.txt updated with correct target name

### 2. **Error Handling Policy Decisions** ðŸŸ¡ MEDIUM
**TODO Items in Code:**
- `Simulator/game_runner.cpp:98` - "decide what to do when fails to load game manager"
- `Simulator/game_runner.cpp:110,117,124,131` - "decide what to do when fails to load algorithm" (4 instances)

**Status:** Error handling mechanisms exist but policies need finalization

### 3. **Algorithm Name Extraction** ðŸŸ¡ MEDIUM
**TODO Items:**
- `comparative_runner.cpp:102,105` - "make sure algorithm names are correct"
- `competitive_runner.cpp:134` - "make sure algorithm names are correct"

**Issue:** Names extracted from .so file paths may need standardization for output files

### 4. **Output Format Verification** ðŸŸ¡ MEDIUM
**Comparative Mode:**
- Result grouping by identical outcomes
- Exact message format matching assignment specification
- Timestamped file naming (`comparative_results_<time>.txt`)

**Competition Mode:**
- Score calculation verification (3 points win, 1 point tie)
- Sorted output format
- Tournament pairing edge cases

### 5. **Final Integration Testing** ðŸŸ¡ MEDIUM
**Missing:**
- End-to-end testing with assignment examples
- Verification against exact output format requirements
- Testing with multiple .so files from different teams

## ðŸŽ¯ IMMEDIATE ACTION PLAN

### Priority 1 - Critical Fix
1. **âœ… Fix Simulator Executable Name - COMPLETED**
   - âœ… Updated `Simulator/CMakeLists.txt` line 45: changed `tanks_game` to `simulator_318835816_211314471`
   - âœ… Updated output directory to `Simulator/` instead of `build/bin/`
   - âœ… Updated all UI and documentation references

### Priority 2 - Code Completion
2. **Resolve TODO Comments**
   - Define error handling policies for library loading failures
   - Implement consistent algorithm name extraction
   - Remove uncertainty comments from code

3. **Verify Output Formats**
   - Test comparative mode with known inputs
   - Test competition mode with sample tournaments  
   - Validate against assignment specification examples

## ðŸ“Š CURRENT STATUS

**Overall Progress:** 90% Complete

**Critical Issues:** 1 (executable naming)  
**Medium Issues:** 4 (verification and polish)

**Estimated Time to Completion:** 4-6 hours focused work

---

## âœ… CONFIRMED WORKING COMPONENTS

For reference, these major components are fully implemented and tested:

- **Project Structure:** All 5 required folders properly organized
- **Core Game Engine:** Complete with collision detection, game objects, board management
- **Threading System:** Full ThreadPool implementation with parallel execution in both modes  
- **Dynamic Library Loading:** Complete LibraryManager with dlopen/dlclose and error handling
- **Registration System:** Auto-registration working with validation and cleanup
- **Command Line Interface:** Full argument parsing for comparative and competition modes
- **Build System:** CMake configured, all libraries building successfully (.so files present)
- **Web UI Server:** Bonus feature complete and operational

## ðŸš€ FINAL STEPS TO SUBMISSION

1. **Fix executable naming** â†’ Test both modes work with correct name
2. **Resolve 5 TODO comments** â†’ Clean up uncertainty in error handling  
3. **Verify output formats** â†’ Test against assignment examples
4. **Final build and package** â†’ Ensure all requirements met

**Success Criteria:** Simulator runs both modes with correct executable name, generates properly formatted output files, and handles all error scenarios gracefully.
