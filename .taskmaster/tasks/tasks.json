        "description": "Enhance FileSatelliteView class with validation members and getter methods without changing existing behavior",
        "details": "Add validation state members (m_isValid, m_errorReason, m_warnings) and corresponding getter methods (isValid(), getErrorReason(), getWarnings()) to FileSatelliteView class. Include private helper methods setError() and addWarning() for internal validation state management. This foundational change enables validation capabilities while maintaining backward compatibility with existing code.",
        "testStrategy": "Run existing FileSatelliteView tests to ensure no regression. Verify new getter methods return expected default values (isValid=true, empty error/warnings). Compile and run file_satellite_view_test to confirm all functionality preserved.",

        "description": "Replace raw board data with processed board and implement comprehensive validation and recovery logic in FileSatelliteView constructor",
        "details": "Replace m_boardData with m_processedBoard and implement initializeAndRecoverBoard() method. Add validation logic to detect critical errors (no tanks, empty boards) and recoverable warnings (dimension mismatches, invalid characters). Implement recovery mechanisms including row padding for short rows and character replacement for invalid symbols. Early exit on unrecoverable errors while collecting warnings for recoverable issues.",
        "testStrategy": "Create test cases for various board configurations: invalid boards should set m_isValid=false, boards with recoverable issues should collect warnings, verify board recovery works correctly (padding, character replacement), confirm getObjectAt() returns corrected characters.",

        "details": "Add isValid(), getErrorReason(), and getWarnings() methods to BoardInfo struct that delegate to the underlying FileSatelliteView instance. Implement safe null-checking and appropriate fallback values when satelliteView is null. No changes to loading logic at this stage - only interface enhancement.",

Add tests to both FileSatelliteView and FileLoader test suites. Cover edge cases like malformed input, extreme dimensions, and boundary conditions.",

Ensure proper error handling flow: validate → handle warnings → proceed or exit.",
